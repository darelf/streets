Jack is a moonshiner. Sort of. He deals in all sorts of liquid illicits, and even
some licit. Famous for "Jack's Brew" which is a hard liquor made from a "secret"
formula. It definitely has a kick, and no one really wants to know what he puts
in it.

A gregarious business man, his operation seems small, but he always has nuyen to
spend. Says "Pal" and "Sweetie" a lot. As far as anyone knows, the only item he
carries for defense is a large combat knife he keeps on his hip.
