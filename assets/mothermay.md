Mother May I is a go-gang leader. She runs the DrekHeds in the Redmond Barrens. The gang is a mix of races,
and doesn't particularly care about anything but partying. Mother is a hard core drinker and is often seen
in drinking games with the other gangers at any of their local bars.

A dwarf that's tough as nails, she refuses to get any chrome mods, and runs on pure adrenaline. She
personally oversees the gang's illegal chip racket and keeps the gang out of trouble by sticking to their own
territory and trying to avoid business lines that are targeted by LEOs. A lot of runners use her chips, though
she also supplies snuff and underage BTLs for the tourists.
