Alexey Koslov recently moved down from Vancouver, where he had lived all his life.
He speaks English fluently and only has a hint of a Russian accent with certain words.
He has begun to settle in Seattle and is always out trying to get a feel of the city.

He is rather to the point about business and tends to be practical about life. He has
an open derision about governmental and corporate control in every facet of peoples
lives. Not having the most street sense, he is always looking to learn from the people around him.
