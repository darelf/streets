A local street doc that makes house calls. Has been known to show up "on scene" if the
price is right. Possessed of a particularly black humor, and lacking in anything
resembling social skills or bedside manner, he is often a good fit for runners.

One issue the doctor runs into often is lack of supplies or equipment. While he is
competent with most any required surgery, patients will often have to supply their
own medical equipment. He can install any cyberware (he claims) that you bring to him.
Quality is not something he guarantees.
