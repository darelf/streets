Hartford is a fixer. He finds shadowrunners, creates crews, and hires them out to
interested clients. Most of his clients are gangs and small time corps. He can also
arrange black market goods for his runners, which are typically delivered through
organized crime syndicates.

It is unclear whether Hartford is connected directly with any of the families, but
he seems to have contacts with several of them.
