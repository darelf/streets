Mal runs a "one-stop" shop in the barrens called Mal's Toy Shop just on the edge of
Touristville. Some specialty bioware, infiltration related items such as micro-drones,
cameras, and grappling hooks, a variety of combat drugs, and even will act as a
broker for temporary "help". The front of the shop sells "adult" toys.

Known as a bit odd, even among the runner community, every fixer who does
work in Redmond has heard of Mal and probably has dealt with her or one of
her people. She has an obsession with dolls that seems to creepily match up
with her high-pitched voice.
