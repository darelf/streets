Jade is a young woman who formerly worked as a stripper at the Syx Pynx, but now is peddling
jazz on the streets. Essentially homeless, she is hopelessly addicted to BTLs, and seems
despondent when not chipped in. She is a good source of information on the local neighborhood,
though she doesn't have much influence and is extremely careful about giving out information
about her clients.


She spends her days sleeping it off in an abandoned gas station in Spiders' territory that is
often used by squatters and other homeless.
