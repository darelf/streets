The Crimson Crush have a contract out to deny a large shipment of ammunition to the
Yaks that run The Joke. They don't care what happens to the shipment, only that it doesn't make
it to its intended destination. No cleanup or other services are being provided.

The shipment is coming into Redmond first by boat, and then from the docks there via truck
to a Yak safe house east of Touristville. The exact route isn't known. The exact quantity and
composition of the shipment isn't known.

What is known, is that it fits on a single truck, it contains "specialty" ammunition which could
mean hollow point, explosive, or some other kind, and that it is being listed on the manifest
as "hazardous waste".
