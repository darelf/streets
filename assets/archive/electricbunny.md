Techno/Electronica group. Only plays abandoned buildings. The face of the group is MisHap.
Local stars in the Seattle area for the last few years, they have a huge following in the Barrens,
among the working class and even among local law enforcement.

A diverse group of modified metahumans, including an Ork, an Elf, and a Troll, they sport extensive body
modifications. They have been known to socialize with less desirables, but they have no known
connections to any criminal organizations, though they have once done a fundraiser for a Lone Star officer
injured in the line of duty.
