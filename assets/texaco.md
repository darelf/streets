Texaco has been in the gun business a long time. Originally a legitimate
weapons dealer for military operations, he has kept his contacts on the supply
side. He deals in all kinds of goods, and isn't picky about who he sells to.

He is a constant smoker, with a pleasant, if gruff, demeanor. He likes his
customers, and will even do some armory work for regulars. If he doesn't like you,
you might want to stay away. They say he's a pretty good shot. And he has access
to a lot of guns.
